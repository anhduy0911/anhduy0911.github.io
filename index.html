								<p> 
									I’m Duy Nguyen, currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/">Minh N. Do</a>. 
									My current research focuses on <b>multimodal learning</b> and <b>representation learning</b>. Recently, I've been diving into ways to handle <b>extreme cases in multimodal systems</b>, where data might be incomplete or inconsistent. It's a fascinating challenge to make models more trustworthy, even when they're working with less-than-perfect data. I work a lot with <b>semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques</b> to address these issues. One of my key interests is <b>uncertainty estimation</b>, where I aim to improve both the reliability and interpretability of the models I develop.
								</p>
								<p> 
									Looking ahead, I’m shifting my focus to <b>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)</b>. My main goal is to enhance their efficiency and reliability while still keeping accuracy high. Rather than developing entirely new large language models, I want to create <b>plug-in techniques</b> — essentially tools that can be easily integrated with existing LLMs. This way, I can help improve their performance in a more scalable and practical way.
								</p>
								<p>
									I've also been fortunate to publish in several venues like ICDM, EAAI, Scientific Reports and PLOS ONE. My past projects have covered a range of topics, from time series prediction and sensor calibration to healthcare AI applications. I’ve worked extensively with technologies like graph neural networks, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning, and I'm always excited to explore new challenges in AI and machine learning!
								</p>
								<p>
									I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam, and grew up here. 
									I got my Bachelor (Engineer) degree in Information & Communication Technology (ICT) from School of Information And Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam.
									<!-- My undergrad research thesis is about detecting pills in medical captures, with the support of information from prescriptions under Graph representation (You can find it <a href="assets/files/[20184249][NguyenAnhDuy][Thesis_NguyenAnhDuy_KGPNet_A_Knowledge_Graph_based_framework_for_Pill_detection].pdf">here</a> if interested).  -->
								</p>
								<p>I am eager to learn, and I am very open to new collaborations.
									Please <a href="#contact">drop me a message</a> if you are interested in a collaboration, or just want to reach out.
									Here is my <a href="assets/files/NguyenAnhDuy_CV.pdf">CV</a> for more details.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/experience.png" alt=""/></span>
								<p>
									Before entering UIUC, I spent a gap year working at a Smart Health Center, founded under the cooporation of Vin University and University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign. My work here involve developing ML/DL frameworks for time series, multimodal data, with major appication to Healthcare domain.
								</p>
								<p>
									During my undergrad, from 2020 to 2022, I worked in Naver-SoICT laboratory, Hanoi University of Science and Technology; before spending two last months of 2022 to do an internship at Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). 
									My works there centered around two projects: the first was about air quality monitoring and forecasting with actual sensor devices, 
									the second was about personal health monitoring with actual mobile application and deep learning-driven tools.
